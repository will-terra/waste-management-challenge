# Waste Management Skip Hire Platform

[![Vercel Deployment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deployed%20on-Vercel-black?logo=vercel)](https://waste-management-challenge.vercel.app/)  
**Live Demo:** [https://waste-management-challenge.vercel.app/](https://waste-management-challenge.vercel.app/)

A responsive web application designed to streamline skip selection for waste management, built as a technical assessment for a Software Engineer role. This solution demonstrates modern frontend architecture, robust error handling, and user-centric design.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Smart Filtering System**  
  Filter skips by size, hire duration, transport cost, road legality, and heavy waste capability.
  
- **Dynamic Content Handling**
  - Empty state illustrations for no-match filters
  - Error boundaries with user-friendly messaging

- **Cross-Device Optimization**  
  Mobile responsive design with breakpoint-specific layouts.

- **State Persistence**  
  Redux-powered state management maintains selections across navigation steps.

- **Accessibility Focus**  
  WCAG-compliant components with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels.

# üß† Design Decisions

### Next.js App Router
Chosen for hybrid static & server rendering to optimize SEO and initial load performance.

### Redux Toolkit
Implemented with RTK Query for centralized API state management and automatic caching.

### Tailwind + MUI Synergy
Combines MUI's design system with Tailwind's utility-first flexibility for rapid iteration.

## Atomic Design Architecture
Adopted Atomic Design methodology to create a maintainable component hierarchy:

- **Atoms**: Foundational elements (buttons, inputs, icons) with strict prop-type contracts  
- **Molecules**: Functional combinations (search bars, filter groups) enforcing component relationships
- **Organisms**: Context-aware modules (header, filter section) handling business logic  

**Implementation Benefits**:
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Strict parent-child dependency boundaries
- üß© Visual regression prevention through composition
- üîç Storybook-driven component development
- ‚ö° Selective hydration with Next.js dynamic imports

Seamlessly integrates with:
- Tailwind's utility-class composition
- Storybook's component isolation
- Redux's state colocation principles

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

- **Memoized State Management**  
  Strategic `useMemo` usage prevents unnecessary re-renders of filter results and complex UI components.

- **Modular Redux Architecture**  
  Split state slices with isolated responsibilities to optimize store updates and reduce reconciliation overhead.

- **Skeleton Loading States**  
  Content placeholders maintain layout stability during asynchronous data operations.

- **Critical Image Prioritization**  
  Next.js image component with lazy loading and priority pre-fetch for above-the-fold assets.
